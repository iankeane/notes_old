Bandwidth              =    Bits per second on a specific link\
End to end principle   =    This states that in a network, app-specific
                                functions ought to reside in the end hosts
                                rather than intermediary nodes, if this can be
                                accomplished correctly.\
Encapsulation          =    The process of taking data from one layer and
                                translating it into another layer, so the data
                                can continue across a network.\
Traffic intensity      =    A measure of the average occupancy of a server or
                                resource during a specified period of time,
                                normally a busy hour.\
Queueing delay         =    How long a packet waits on a queue to be
                                transmitted onto a link\
Transmission delay     =    Time required to load bits onto a medium\
Propagation delay      =    Time required for a single bit to traverse from one
                                side of a medium to the other\
Circuit switching      =    Traditional method of reserving resources for the
                                duration of a communication session between
                                hosts (not used for the internet)\
Packet switching       =    Alternative to circuit switching where resources
                                are not reserved, and messages are therefore
                                queued if resources are not sufficient\
Multiplexing           =    The job of gathering data chunks at the source host
                                from different sockets, encapsulating them with
                                header info (used for demultiplexing) to create
                                segments, and passing the segments to the
                                network layer\
Payload                =    The "actual data" in a packet or file minus all
                                headers attached for transport and minus all
                                descriptive meta-data.\

Peer to peer           =    Architecture with minimal or no reliance on
                                always-on infrastructure servers, which instead
                                uses direct communication between
                                intermittently connected hosts\
Distributed hash table =    Is a class of a decentralized distributed system
                                that provides a lookup service similar to a
                                hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a
                                DHT, and any participating node can efficiently
                                retrieve the value associated with a given
                                key.\

TCP                      =  Transmission Control Protocol, more reliable of
                                the two protocols used by the Internet.  Uses a
                                "handshake", !!! secures a TCP connection as
                                first step. Connections require a teardown.
                                Throttles connections using congestion control

Connection oriented      =  A communication session or a semi-permanent
                                connection is established before any useful
                                data can be transferred, and where a stream of
                                data is delivered in the same order as it was

SYN                      =  Used to initiate the three-way handshaking
                                process in TCP. (1 bit ) Synchronize sequence
                                numbers. Only the first packet sent from each
                                end should have this flag set. Some other flags
                                and fields change meaning based on this flag,
                                and some are only valid for when it is set, and

FIN                      =  An orderly close of an existing connection in

                                sent.(1 bit TCP flag - No more data from
                                sender)\
Three way handshake      =  Process of authenticating a TCP connection

slow start               =
Piggybacking             =  Sending control information along with data
Active open              =  Call a device (client process) using TCP takes the
                                active role and initiates the connection by
                                sending a TCP SYN message to start the
                                connection.\
Passive open             =  Can specify that the device (server process) is
                                waiting for an active OPEN from a specific
                                client. It does not generate any TCP message
                                segment. The server processes listening for the
                                clients are in Passive\
UDP                      =  User Datagram Protocol, more lightweight of the
                                two protocols used by the Internet.
                                Connectionless, does not use handshaking or
                                require teardown. Does not guarantee that
                                packets will reach their destination, and
                                packets may arrive out of order. Does not
                                control congestion. Many firewalls block UDP

Finite state machine     =  An automaton with a limited number of states

Pipelining               =  Alternative to stop-and-wait, where packets can
                                be transmitted without acknowledgements.  This
                                means the range of sequence numbers must be
                                increased, the sender and receiver may need to
                                buffer more packets, and adjustments may have
                                to be made for error handling.\
Round trip time          =  Time that elapses from when a client requests
                                the base HTML file until the entire file is
                                received by the client. Includes propagation,
                                queueing, and processing delays. The formula

Go Back N                =  Method of pipeline error handling where a

                                packets in the pipeline.  Packets are
                                acknowledged cumulatively. If a packet is
                                determined to be out of order, it and all
                                subsequent packages are discarded.\
