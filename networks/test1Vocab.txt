Logical communication     =     Communication that emulates a direct connection
                                    between hosts, even if they are not
                                    physically connected. This type of
                                    communication abstracts away some
                                    networking details related to
                                    infrastructure
Multiplexing              =     The job of gathering data chuncks at the source
                                    host from different sockets, encapsulating
                                    them with header info (used for
                                    demultiplexing) to create segments, and
                                    passing the segments to the network layer
Demultiplexing            =     The job of examining the transport layer's
                                    fields and using that information to direct
                                    data segments to the correct socket
Connection‐oriented       =

Best‐effort delivery      =     A protocol that makes its best effort to
                                    deliver segments between communicating
                                    hosts but does not guarantee orderly
                                    delivery.
Flow control              =     
Sequence number           =     A field in a packet used to check if it has
                                    been received in the correct order. This
                                    field can be one bit, because it only needs
                                    to know if it is correct in relation to the
                                    surrounding packets.
TCP Segment               =     A chunk of data (similar to a packet) in the
                                    transport layer
Finite state machine      =     An automaton with a limited number of states
                                    connected by transition arrows, whose
                                    transitions are determined by conditions
UDP Checksum              =     A summation of all four pieces of a UDP segment
                                    header with the bits reversed, which when
                                    added to the non reversed summation should
                                    result in all ones. This calculation is
                                    used to detect alteration of data segments
                                    or errors.
End‐end principle         =     This states that in a network, app-specific
                                    functions ought to reside in the end hosts
                                    rather than intermediary nodes, if this can
                                    be accomplished correctly.
Connectionless            =     
ARQ protocol              =     Automatic Repeat Request protocols, these are
                                    protocols that use positive and negative
                                    acknowledgements to confirm message
                                    exchanges
ACK                       =     A positive acknowledgement in an ARQ protocol
NAK                       =     A negative acknowledgement in an ARQ protocol
Stop‐and‐wait protocol    =     Protocols where the sender cannot receive more
                                    data from the upper layer until it receives
                                    an ACK or NAK
Duplicate ACK             =     An ACK that has already been received by a
                                    client. Duplicate ACKs are used to locate
                                    and correct transmission errors
cumulative ACK            =     
Pipelining                =     Alternative to stop-and-wait, where packets can
                                    be transmitted without acknowledgements.
                                    This means the range of sequence numbers
                                    must be increased, the sender and receiver
                                    may need to buffer more packets, and
                                    adjustments may have to be made for error
                                    handling.
Go‐Back‐N                 =     Method of pipeline error handling where a
                                    sender is only allowed to send N
                                    unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
                                    Packets are acknowledged cumulitively. If a
                                    packet is determined to be out of order,
                                    it and all subsequent packages are
                                    discarded.
Selective repeat          =     Method of pipeline error handling
Cumulative ACK            =     ACKs that are handled one-by-one from a queue
                                    of ACKs
Sliding window protocol   =     Protocol that uses a dynamically adjusting
                                    window of acceptible unacknowledged packets
Utilization               =     
Three‐way handshake       =     Process of authenticating a TCP connection
                                    before any transfer takes place

congestion control        =     Used in TCP, prevents any one host from
                                    creating excessive traffic by regulating
                                    the rate at which the sending sides can
                                    send traffic.
