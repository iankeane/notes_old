Layers
------
Application layer          =    Services specific to the application being
                                   used, implemented in the app. code,
                                   including HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMTP, etc.
                                   Application-specific message.
Transport layer            =    Delivers to a process on a host,implemented in
                                   the OS code.  Examples are TCP and
                                   UDP. Messages here are called segments or
                                   datagrams.
Network layer              =    Delivers to a remote host, implemented in the
                                   OS. Examples are IP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.
Data Link layer            =    Delivers to a directly connected host,
                                   implemented in hardware. Examples are
                                   ethernet, X.25, ARP, NDP, etc.
App Layer Protocol         =    Hereafter referred to as ALP, a protocol that
                                   defines how an application's processes send
                                   messages. This includes: the types of
                                   messages exchanged, the syntax of message
                                   types, semantics of the fields, and rules
                                   for determining when and how a process
                                   sends/receives a process, includes HTTP,
                                   SMTP, etc
Datagram socket           =     Discrete packets of data that may arrive out of
                                   order or be lost while in transit. datagram
                                   sockets are message-based, able to communicate
                                   with multiple peers at the same time
TCP Segment               =     A chunk of data (similar to a packet) in the
                                   transport layer

Formula Stuff

Processing delay           =    Is the time it takes routers to process the
                                    packet header. Processing delay is a key
                                    component in network delay.
Transmission delay         =    Time required to load bits onto a medium
Transmission rate          =    How fast data can be transmitted bits/second
bandwidth                  =    Bits per second on a specific link
Queueing delay             =    How long a packet waits on a queue to be
                                    transmitted onto a link
Propagation delay          =    Time required for a single bit to traverse from
                                    one side of a medium to the other
Average throughput         =    Throughput is the rate at which the sending
                                    process can deliver bits to the receiving
                                    process. The formula for average throughput
                                    is !!!
Traffic intensity          =    A measure of the average occupancy of a server
                                    or resource during a specified period of
                                    time, normally a busy hour.
Utilization                =    The ratio of current network traffic to the
                                    maximum traffic that the port can handle.
Maximum Transmission Unit  =    Largest complete IP packet that can be put in a
                                    data link frame
Round trip time            =    Time that elapses from when a client requests
                                    the base HTML file until the entire file is
                                    received by the client. Includes
                                    propagation, queueing, and processing
                                    delays. The formula for RTT is !!!
P2P distribution time      =    The time it takes to get a copy of the file to
                                    all peers attempting to download the file.
                                    The formula for distribution time is !!!
Physical medium            =    The transmission path over which a signal
                                    propagates. Ex: optical fiber, which has
                                    emerged as the most commonly used
                                    transmission medium for long-distance
                                    communications.
Maximum Segment Size       =    Amount of data that can be put into a Transport
                                    segment
Payload                    =    The "actual data" in a packet or file minus all
                                    headers attached for transport and minus
                                    all descriptive meta-data.


Packet Switching
----------------

Packet switch              =    Takes a packet and forwards it to an outgoing
                                   communication link. Examples include
                                   routers and link-layer switches. can
                                   deliver bits to the receiving process. The
                                   formula for average throughput is !!!
Circuit switching          =    Traditional method of reserving resources for
                                   the duration of a communication session
                                   between hosts (not used for the internet)
Packet switching           =    Alternative to circuit switching where
                                   resources are not reserved, and messages
                                   are therefore queued if resources are not
                                   sufficient

Elastic application       =      Applications which can make use of as much or
                                        as little throughput as is available. This
                                        is an alternative to bandwidth-sensitive
                                        applications.
Non persistent connection =      A connection where each request/response pair
                                        is sent to over a separate TCP connection
Persistent connection     =      A connection where all request/response pairs
                                        are sent over the same TCP connection
User agent                =      acts as a client in a network protocol used in
                                        communications within a client–server
                                        distributed computing system.
Multiplexing              =      The job of gathering data chunks at the source
                                        host from different sockets, encapsulating
                                        them with header info (used for
                                        demultiplexing) to create segments, and
                                        passing the segments to the network layer
Demultiplexing            =      The job of examining the transport layer's
                                        fields and using that information to direct
                                        data segments to the correct socket
piggybacking              =      Sending control information along with data
End to end principle      =      This states that in a network, app-specific
                                        functions ought to reside in the end hosts
                                        rather than intermediary nodes, if this can
                                        be accomplished correctly.
Connectionless            =      Describes communication between two network end
                                        points in which a message can be sent from
                                        one end point to another without prior
                                        arrangement. The device at one end of the
                                        communication transmits data to the other,
                                        without first ensuring that the recipient
                                        is available and ready to receive the data.
Pipelining                =      Alternative to stop-and-wait, where packets can
                                        be transmitted without acknowledgements.
                                        This means the range of sequence numbers
                                        must be increased, the sender and receiver
                                        may need to buffer more packets, and
                                        adjustments may have to be made for error
                                        handling.
Go Back N                 =      Method of pipeline error handling where a
                                        sender is only allowed to send N
                                        unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
                                        Packets are acknowledged cumulatively. If a
                                        packet is determined to be out of order,
                                        it and all subsequent packages are
                                        discarded.
TCP flags                 =      Control bits which contains 9 1-bit flags such
                                        as NS, CWR, ECE, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN
flow control              =      A single TCP sender from overwhelming its receiver
congestion control        =      Used in TCP, prevents any one host from
                                        creating excessive traffic by regulating
                                        the rate at which the sending sides can
                                        send traffic.
