Cookie                   =      A file stored in a host's database holding
                                   information used to identify the client.
                                   This has to be done because HTTP is
                                   stateless.

Flooding                 =      forwarding by a router of a packet from any

                                   arrived. Flooding is a way to distribute
                                   routing information updates quickly to every

User agent               =      acts as a client in a network protocol used in

IP address               =      An address used to identify a host. Stored in 4
                                   bytes separated by periods in decimal.
Hostname                 =      A mnemonic identifier for  an IP address,
                                   accessed through the DNS
Domain Name System       =      DNS, service that translates hostnames to IP
                                   addresses. DNS is a distributed database
                                   hierarchy of DNS servers, and also is an
                                   ALP that allows hosts to query the
                                   database. Runs over UDP and uses port 53.
Root DNS servers         =      The 13 servers in the Internet that are at the
                                   root of the DNS hierarchy
Authoritative DNS server =      Server that hosts an organization's DNS records
                                   that are used to map the names of their
                                   hosts to an IP address. Organizations may
                                   host their own or pay to have these records
                                   stored by a service provider.
Recursive DNS query      =     The client makes a DNS request and the server
                                   must query other DNS servers until it finds
                                   the record or until it determines the record
                                   does not exist
Iterative DNS query      =     The client makes a DNS request and the server
                                   can either return the record or refer the
                                   client to a different server (both explained

P2P distribution time    =      The time it takes to get a copy of the file to

                                   The formula for distribution time is !!!
Hash function            =      any function that can be used to map data of
                                   arbitrary size to data of fixed size into a hash table
Distributed hash table   =      is a class of a decentralized distributed
                                   system that provides a lookup service
                                   similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs
                                   are stored in a DHT, and any participating
                                   node can efficiently retrieve the value
                                   associated with a given key.
TCP                      =      Transmission Control Protocol, more reliable of
                                  the two protocols used by the Internet.
                                  Uses a "handshake", !!! secures a TCP
                                  connection as first step. Connections
                                  require a teardown. Throttles connections
                                  using congestion control techniques.
                                  Unencrypted.
UDP                      =      User Datagram Protocol, more lightweight of the
                                  two protocols used by the Internet.
                                  Connectionless, does not use handshaking or
                                  require teardown. Does not guarantee that
                                  packets will reach their destination, and
                                  packets may arrive out of order. Does not
                                  control congestion. Many firewalls block
                                  UDP traffic. Unencrypted.
Secure Sockets Layer UDP =      !!! ask professor
Secure Sockets Layer TCP =      Enhanced version of TCP that provides

                                  encryption, data integrity, and end-point
                                  authentification. Is not a separate
                                  protocol from TCP, but has its own API.

Unchoking                =      In a P2P system, when a group of peers

Logical communication     =     Communication that emulates a direct connection
                                   between hosts, even if they are not
                                   physically connected. This type of
                                   communication abstracts away some
                                   networking details related to
                                   infrastructure
Multiplexing              =     The job of gathering data chunks at the source
                                   host from different sockets, encapsulating
                                   them with header info (used for
                                   demultiplexing) to create segments, and
                                   passing the segments to the network layer
Demultiplexing            =     The job of examining the transport layer's
                                   fields and using that information to direct
                                   data segments to the correct socket
Connection oriented       =     A communication session or a semi-permanent
                                   connection is established before any useful
                                   data can be transferred, and where
                                   a stream of data is delivered in the same
                                   order as it was sent.
Full duplex               =     Data can be transmitted in both directions on a

Sequence number           =     A field in a packet used to check if it has
                                   been received in the correct order. This
                                   field can be one bit, because it only needs
                                   to know if it is correct in relation to the
                                   surrounding packets.
TCP Segment               =     A chunk of data (similar to a packet) in the

Finite state machine      =     An automaton with a limited number of states

UDP Checksum              =     A summation of all four pieces of a UDP segment
                                   header with the bits reversed, which when
                                   added to the non reversed summation should
                                   result in all ones. This calculation is
                                   used to detect alteration of data segments
                                   or errors.
End to end principle      =     This states that in a network, app-specific
                                   functions ought to reside in the end hosts
                                   rather than intermediary nodes, if this can
                                   be accomplished correctly.
Connectionless            =     Describes communication between two network end

ARQ protocol              =     Automatic Repeat Request protocols, these are

Pipelining                =     Alternative to stop-and-wait, where packets can

                                   This means the range of sequence numbers
                                   must be increased, the sender and receiver
                                   may need to buffer more packets, and

                                   Packets are acknowledged cumulatively. If a
                                   packet is determined to be out of order,
                                   it and all subsequent packages are
