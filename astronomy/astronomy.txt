Basic Concepts
    Galaxy:
        localized group of stars orbiting a central point
            most galaxies have a black whole at the center
            the milky way is a larger than average galaxy
        galaxies are the 'building blocks of the universe'
    only our solar system is in the scope of this class
        the sun is only one star out of billions in our galaxy

Powers of Ten and Scale
    orders of magnitude are used for imprecise estimation
        77 and 100 are identical in terms of order of magnitude
    the moon = 10^7 OM from the Earth
    venus = 10^10 OM from the Earth
        so it will take 10^2 times longer to to reach venus than the moon
    jupiter = 10^8 OM from Earth
    kuiper belt = 10^15 OM from Earth
        kuiper belt is the effective edge of the solar system for this class
        (asteroid belt made of ice)
    one light year = 10^18 
    1 astronomical unit (AU) 
        = distance from the Earth to the Sun 
        = 93  * 10^7 mi
        = 1.5 * 10^8 km
        ~ 10^11 m
    mass of the sun ~ 2*10^30
    mass of the Earth ~ 2*10^24
        2*10^30 / 6*10^24 = 20*10^29 / 6*10^24 = 300,000
            the sun has 300,000x more mass than the earth


10 m = 10^7
10 m m = 10^13

EXAM ONE MOVED BACK ONE WEEK

HW: 
    milankovitch cycles (sp?)
    motion of the moon
    eclipses

section 2-1 is not covered on the exam


Milankovitch Cycles
    earth moves in an elliptical orbit
        the sun is at one of the focuses of the ellipse
        this means that sometimes the earth will be closer to the sun
            closest distance is parahelion
            farthest is aphelion
        the measure of an eclipse is called the eccentricity
            varies from 0-1
                0 is closer to a circle, 1 is closer to a line
            the difference between earth's para-and-aphelion is 5m km
        precession is the slow change of the axis of the Earth's tilt
            currently the earth is tilted at ~23.4 degrees
                what is vertical?
    earth's orbit is so close to a circle, it cannot be detected as an ellipse
        by the naked eye
    Milankovich did not discover that the earth's orbit is an ellipse
    he discovered 3 things:
        1. that the eccentricity changes by 1.77% every ~100k years
        this change is due to gravitational disturbances from other planets in
            the solar system (perturbations)
        newton's physics for predicting the earth's orbit only works for a two
            body system
        2. that in addition to precession, the earth's axis
            vascillates from 22 to 25 degrees 
        3. the earth's position during the seasons relative to the
            para-and-aphelion can change over time
            right now, during summer we are closer to the aphelion in the
                northern hemisphere
        the combination of these three discoveries account for a pattern that
            is called the Milankovich cycle
                these cycles are only observable over hundreds of thousands of years

Motion of the Moon
    the moon keeps the same face toward the earth
        this is called syncronous rotation
        the period of rotation around the axis is the same as the period of
            revolution around earth
        lunar day == lunar year
        this is a very common situation for moons
    geometry causes a relationship between:
        1. phase of the moon
        2. direction of the moon
        3. time of day

Sun vs Stars as Reference Point
    moon goes around the earth in 29.5 days, or 27.3
        both are correct
        one measures full moon to full moon
            this is the synodic period
            this does not account for the motion between the sun
        the other uses the stars
            counts the time to return to exact relative position, unrelated to
            the phase

Eclipses
    Solar:
        moon's shadow blocks the sun
        new moon
    Lunar:
        earth's shadow blocks the moon
            full moon
    usually on a full moon, the moon's shadow misses the earth
        this is because the moon's orbit is not on the ecliptic plane
            it is off by 5 degrees
    according to this, there SHOULD be two solar and two lunar eclipses every year
        this does not happen because the moon's orbital plane also rotates slowly
        instead it lines up 2x per 346.6 days
            this is called an eclipse year/draconian year
    we get an eclipse when the moon phase lines up with the line of nodes
        this happens every 18.2 years
            this is called a saros cycle

Geometry of Eclipses
    Moon:
        Diameter = 3474km
        r = 384000 km
    Sun:
        diameter = 1.4*10^6 km
        r = 1.5*10^8 km
    we can use S = r(theta) to find the size of the shadow (roughly) (using radians)
        this isn't the formula we really need
            we don't want the arc, we want the chord
        instead we use the small angle formula
            if theta is less than a degree, we can do r(theta)/206265 = D
                (using arcseconds)
                1 degree = 60 arcminutes
                1 arcminute = 60 arcseconds
                1 arcminute = 1', 1 arcsecond = 1''
                206265 is a conversion factor for these measurements
            the book calls theta the angular diameter and D the linear diameter
    theta(moon) = (206265(D))/r
                = (206265(3474))/384000
    theta(sun) = 206265(1.4*10^6)/1.5*10^8
        theta(moon) ~ theta(sun)
        this is why the eclipse works despite the size difference of the sun
            and moon

Looking at Eclipses
    what you see is the corona of the sun
        this is not normally visible
        the corona won't hurt your eyes (?)
            the photosphere is what hurts your eye due to UV radiation
    shadow of the moon is called the umbra
        partial shadows are called penumbra
        this happens when you are not directly under the shadow
            "partial solar eclipse" vs "total solar eclipse"
        a partial eclipse will hurt your eye
    annular eclipse???

Calendar Systems
    the motion of celestial objects repeats in observable patterns
    in the past, every king would have a court astronomer
        this was partially for astrological reasons (pseudoscience)
        the astronomer was also responsible for timekeeping
            generally they focused on the synodic period (29.5 days)

Handling Leap Years
    the earth goes around the sun every 365.24219 days
    all calendars have compromises
    historically, the years have been broken up this way:
        6 months x 30 days
        6 months x 29 days
            this means that every month begins on a full moon
                each week is a moon phase
            adds up to 354 days, which is not very accurate
            slips 11 days per year
            this is how the muslim calendar works
                holy days change time of year
    egyptian method:
        12 months x 30 days = 360 days
            remaining days are replaced by a feast
    hebrew method:
        every 3 years add one month (interpolation)
            this month is 33 days
    roman method:
        caesar introduced the leap year
            every fourth year, add a day
            this gets us to 365.25 days per year
            pretty close, but still causes time slipping
        he also added three months to that year to fix the equinox (by decree)
            historians called it the "year of confusion"
            15 months long
    gregorian method:
        time had slipped by 11 days by 1582
        by papal decree, Oct 4, 1582 is followed by Oct 15
            this is after the protestant reformation
            it took some time for everyone to switch
            by the 1700's, everyone was using the gregorian calendar
        gregory kept the leap year, but added the stipulation that:
            every year that ends in 00 is a leap year, except those divisible by 400
                this brings us to 365.2425 days

Copernican Revolution
    Copernicus:
        mid 1500's
    Tycho Brahe:
        1600
    Johannes Kepler:
        early 1600's
    Galileo:
        early 1600's
    Newton:
        late 1600's

    geocentric model:
        earth at center
        everything orbits the earth
        most popular model at the time
    heliocentric model:
        sun at center
        everything orbits the sun

The Greek Heliocentric Model
    the greeks seriously considered this model
        knew that we could be in motion without feeling it
        rejected the model based on observed data
        (only mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn observable with naked eye)
    aristotle argued that if the earth orbits the sun:
        we should see the angle between the same stars shrinking and growing
            over time (parallax effect)
        the issue is that the stars are so far away that the parallax shift is
            difficult to observe
            this was not observed until 1836
        aristotle know of this issue, but he said it didn't make sense for the
            "sphere of the stars" to be so far away from saturn
            "why would a create create so much empty space?"
