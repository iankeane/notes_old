Basic Concepts
    Galaxy:
        localized group of stars orbiting a central point
            most galaxies have a black whole at the center
            the milky way is a larger than average galaxy
        galaxies are the 'building blocks of the universe'
    only our solar system is in the scope of this class
        the sun is only one star out of billions in our galaxy

Powers of Ten and Scale
    orders of magnitude are used for imprecise estimation
        77 and 100 are identical in terms of order of magnitude
    the moon = 10^7 OM from the Earth
    venus = 10^10 OM from the Earth
        so it will take 10^2 times longer to to reach venus than the moon
    jupiter = 10^8 OM from Earth
    kuiper belt = 10^15 OM from Earth
        kuiper belt is the effective edge of the solar system for this class
        (asteroid belt made of ice)
    one light year = 10^18 
    1 astronomical unit (AU) 
        = distance from the Earth to the Sun 
        = 93  * 10^7 mi
        = 1.5 * 10^8 km
        ~ 10^11 m
    mass of the sun ~ 2*10^30
    mass of the Earth ~ 2*10^24
        2*10^30 / 6*10^24 = 20*10^29 / 6*10^24 = 300,000
            the sun has 300,000x more mass than the earth


10 m = 10^7
10 m m = 10^13

EXAM ONE MOVED BACK ONE WEEK

HW: 
    milankovitch cycles (sp?)
    motion of the moon
    eclipses

section 2-1 is not covered on the exam


Milankovitch Cycles
    earth moves in an elliptical orbit
        the sun is at one of the focuses of the ellipse
        this means that sometimes the earth will be closer to the sun
            closest distance is parahelion
            farthest is aphelion
        the measure of an eclipse is called the eccentricity
            varies from 0-1
                0 is closer to a circle, 1 is closer to a line
            the difference between earth's para-and-aphelion is 5m km
        precession is the slow change of the axis of the Earth's tilt
            currently the earth is tilted at ~23.4 degrees
                what is vertical?
    earth's orbit is so close to a circle, it cannot be detected as an ellipse
        by the naked eye
    Milankovich did not discover that the earth's orbit is an ellipse
    he discovered 3 things:
        1. that the eccentricity changes by 1.77% every ~100k years
        this change is due to gravitational disturbances from other planets in
            the solar system (perturbations)
        newton's physics for predicting the earth's orbit only works for a two
            body system
        2. that in addition to precession, the earth's axis
            vascillates from 22 to 25 degrees 
        3. the earth's position during the seasons relative to the
            para-and-aphelion can change over time
            right now, during summer we are closer to the aphelion in the
                northern hemisphere
        the combination of these three discoveries account for a pattern that
            is called the Milankovich cycle
                these cycles are only observable over hundreds of thousands of years

Motion of the Moon
    the moon keeps the same face toward the earth
        this is called syncronous rotation
        the period of rotation around the axis is the same as the period of
            revolution around earth
        lunar day == lunar year
        this is a very common situation for moons
    geometry causes a relationship between:
        1. phase of the moon
        2. direction of the moon
        3. time of day

Sun vs Stars as Reference Point
    moon goes around the earth in 29.5 days, or 27.3
        both are correct
        one measures full moon to full moon
            this is the synodic period
            this does not account for the motion between the sun
        the other uses the stars
            counts the time to return to exact relative position, unrelated to
            the phase

Eclipses
    Solar:
        moon's shadow blocks the sun
        new moon
    Lunar:
        earth's shadow blocks the moon
            full moon
    usually on a full moon, the moon's shadow misses the earth
        this is because the moon's orbit is not on the ecliptic plane
            it is off by 5 degrees
    according to this, there SHOULD be two solar and two lunar eclipses every year
        this does not happen because the moon's orbital plane also rotates slowly
        instead it lines up 2x per 346.6 days
            this is called an eclipse year/draconian year
    we get an eclipse when the moon phase lines up with the line of nodes
        this happens every 18.2 years
            this is called a saros cycle

Geometry of Eclipses
    Moon:
        Diameter = 3474km
        r = 384000 km
    Sun:
        diameter = 1.4*10^6 km
        r = 1.5*10^8 km
    we can use S = r(theta) to find the size of the shadow (roughly) (using radians)
        this isn't the formula we really need
            we don't want the arc, we want the chord
        instead we use the small angle formula
            if theta is less than a degree, we can do r(theta)/206265 = D
                (using arcseconds)
                1 degree = 60 arcminutes
                1 arcminute = 60 arcseconds
                1 arcminute = 1', 1 arcsecond = 1''
                206265 is a conversion factor for these measurements
            the book calls theta the angular diameter and D the linear diameter
    theta(moon) = (206265(D))/r
                = (206265(3474))/384000
    theta(sun) = 206265(1.4*10^6)/1.5*10^8
        theta(moon) ~ theta(sun)
        this is why the eclipse works despite the size difference of the sun
            and moon

Looking at Eclipses
    what you see is the corona of the sun
        this is not normally visible
        the corona won't hurt your eyes (?)
            the photosphere is what hurts your eye due to UV radiation
    shadow of the moon is called the umbra
        partial shadows are called penumbra
        this happens when you are not directly under the shadow
            "partial solar eclipse" vs "total solar eclipse"
        a partial eclipse will hurt your eye
    annular eclipse???

Calendar Systems
    the motion of celestial objects repeats in observable patterns
    in the past, every king would have a court astronomer
        this was partially for astrological reasons (pseudoscience)
        the astronomer was also responsible for timekeeping
            generally they focused on the synodic period (29.5 days)

Handling Leap Years
    the earth goes around the sun every 365.24219 days
    all calendars have compromises
    historically, the years have been broken up this way:
        6 months x 30 days
        6 months x 29 days
            this means that every month begins on a full moon
                each week is a moon phase
            adds up to 354 days, which is not very accurate
            slips 11 days per year
            this is how the muslim calendar works
                holy days change time of year
    egyptian method:
        12 months x 30 days = 360 days
            remaining days are replaced by a feast
    hebrew method:
        every 3 years add one month (interpolation)
            this month is 33 days
    roman method:
        caesar introduced the leap year
            every fourth year, add a day
            this gets us to 365.25 days per year
            pretty close, but still causes time slipping
        he also added three months to that year to fix the equinox (by decree)
            historians called it the "year of confusion"
            15 months long
    gregorian method:
        time had slipped by 11 days by 1582
        by papal decree, Oct 4, 1582 is followed by Oct 15
            this is after the protestant reformation
            it took some time for everyone to switch
            by the 1700's, everyone was using the gregorian calendar
        gregory kept the leap year, but added the stipulation that:
            every year that ends in 00 is a leap year, except those divisible by 400
                this brings us to 365.2425 days

Copernican Revolution
    Copernicus:
        mid 1500's
    Tycho Brahe:
        1600
    Johannes Kepler:
        early 1600's
    Galileo:
        early 1600's
    Newton:
        late 1600's

    geocentric model:
        earth at center
        everything orbits the earth
        most popular model at the time
    heliocentric model:
        sun at center
        everything orbits the sun

The Greek Heliocentric Model
    the greeks seriously considered this model
        knew that we could be in motion without feeling it
        rejected the model based on observed data
        (only mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn observable with naked eye)
    aristotle argued that if the earth orbits the sun:
        we should see the angle between the same stars shrinking and growing
            over time (parallax effect)
        the issue is that the stars are so far away that the parallax shift is
            difficult to observe
            this was not observed until 1836
        aristotle know of this issue, but he said it didn't make sense for the
            "sphere of the stars" to be so far away from saturn
            "why would a create create so much empty space?"

Identifying Planets (the Greeks)
    planeta in means "wanderer" in latin
        greeks also refered to planets as wanderers
    the constallations gave a framework for recognizing parts of the sky
    the planets were the only objects that did not move predictibly
        this is how planets were first identified

Pre-Copurnican Problems of Planetary Motion
    the problem: everything in the sky moves systematically except the planets
        only naked eye planets were visible at this time
        Mercury and Venus are always close to the Sun (difficult to see)
            never seen at night
        Mars Jupiter and Saturn generally move west but not always
            once a year they stop and move backwards
                "retrograde motion"

Geocentric Answers to Planetary Motion (greeks)
    explainations of "wandering stars"
        the greeks did not think of planets the way we do
        still believed in the "fire, water, earth, air" model of the universe
        the fifth essence was called "the aether", representing the things
            outside of Earth
    the greeks theorized that the inner planets were on a second orbit around
        the sun in addition to the orbit it shares with the rest of the sky
        CLARIFY
        "epicycles"
    they theorized that the other planets also had smaller orbits within their
        large orbits, explaining retrograde
    this "cleaning up" of the geocentric model was the work of Ptolomy
    unaddressed issues:
        varying speeds of planets
        varying brightness of planets throughout the year

Heliocentric Answers to Planetary Motion
    the planets closer to the sun always appear in the sky near the sun because
        of their position relative to the earth
        axiomatic explaination
        this is one of the biggest factors contributing to heliocentrism's
            adoption
    the behavior of the outer planets is also handled naturally by the
        heliocentric model
        if an inner planet is moving around the sun faster than an outer
            planet, it causes retrograde motion in the sky
            the "loop" is caused by earth passing mars
        planets closer to the sun generally move faster

Copernicus's Heliocentrism
    copernicus had a 'medieval' mindset
        assumed that orbits were perfect circles
        in order to make that work with observed data, he had to introduce
            epicycles

(Lab)

Ecliptic Plane
    low in summer, high in winter
        this is due to the earth's tilt
        north pole faces the sun in summer
        south pole faces the sun in winter
    annotate how to find the height of the sun during the summer solstace on a
        given latitude !!!

Starmap
    use the magnitude system
        bright objects have low magnitudes
        faint objects are around the 6th magnitude
        bright objects are aronud 1 and 2 magnitudes
    the greeks though that it looked like the stars could be grouped into 6
        categories based on brightness
    centuries later, this was turned into a system
    rule: when the magnitude changes by 5, the brightness is multiplied by 100
        each magnitude is a factor of sqrt(100) ~ 2.512
            (2.5)^5 ~ 100
        ???
        this is because the eye responds to light with a logarithmic dropoff
    there are 0th magnatude stars as well
        Vega is close to 0th magnetude
    there are also negative magnitudes
        sirius is -1.4
        jupiter is -2.4
        venus is -4
        full moon is -12
        sun is -26

Telescopes
    "level of magnification" is a bad metric
        focal length of the primary lens (mirror)/focal length of eyepeice
            this can be changed by changing eyepeices
            high magnification is frustrating
                more sensitive to vibrations
    worthwhile metrics:
        light gathering power
            area of the primary mirror
        resolution
            ability to see fine detail
            also determined by mirror size

Types of Telescopes
    Dabsonian:
        newtian telescope
            light comes through the top and is deflected by a second, angled 45 degrees
                mirror into the eyepeice
    Casagarian:
        eyepiece at the bottom of the telescope
        second mirror is not angled, goes through the bottom

Tycho Brahe
    royal astronomer
        had his nose chopped off in a duel
        had a pet moose
        died at a party from kidney issues
    best observer of the skies up until his time
        no telescopes yet
        best naked-eye dataset
    Kepler was his subordinate
        kepler ended up with the data set after Brahe's death

Kepler
    analyzed data set for 20 years
    used it to create "Kepler's 3 Laws"
        1. Planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus
            Kepler did not have an explanation why this is true
        2. Equal areas of an orbit are "swept out" in equal times
            this refers to the area of the segment made between two earth
                positions on the orbit and the sun (focus)
            this means that the speed of the planet along its orbit increases
                as it gets closer to the sun
            kepler theorized that there was some kind of magnetic influence
            from the sun
                no concept of gravity yet
        !!! Third law tomorrow

Ellipses
    symmetric about both axes
        you can determine the whole ellipse from just one quarter
    "size" of the ellipse is the semimajor axis
        distance from the origin to the farthest point in the ellips
        distance from the outermost points is the "major axis"
        "sort of" like the radius of the circle
        the other axes are called semiminor axes
    foci:
        an ellipse is defined as every point s.t. the distance between that
            point and the two focii is the same constant
    eccentricity:
        a = semimajor axis
        b = semiminor axis
        c = focus
        c/a = eccentricity
        0 <= e <= 1
            e = 0 is a circle
            e = 1 is a line (basically)

----------------------------


Kepler (cont'd)
    3. (period (in years))^2 = (semimajor axis)^3
            applies only to Mercuray, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
            this law is stange, because it is setting years equal to a distance
                conversion factor is missing
                this can be ignored because there is a conversion factor of 1
                    1 earth year
                later, newton defines the law with a conversion factor:
                    p^2 = (4(pi^2)(a^3))/(G(M1+m2))
            there is no mass taken into account in kepler's 3rd law
                it can be ignored for two decimal places b/c the difference
                    between the mass of the sun and the mass of the planet is
                    so large
            kepler also could not explain this relationship

Galileo's Books
    "The Starry Messenger"
        book about his discoveries with the telescope
    Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems
        defense of the heliocentric theory
    Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences
        book about mechanics/strength of materials
        this is where a lot of newton's ideas came from

Galileo's Discoveries with the Telescope
    craters on the moon
    sunspots (may have contributed to Galileo's later blindness)
        the heliocentric model had been integrated into theology by this point
            thomas aquinas had helped develop this model
            created a progression of perfection , with hell being at the center of
                the earth and god being beyond the stars
            everything beyond the Earth was in the realm of perfection
                according to this scheme, comets were in the Earth's atmosphere
                "disturbed the perfection of the heavens"
            the belief concerning the moon was that the moon was perfect, but
                was reflecting imperfections from the earth
                this explained splotches in the moon
    when Galileo said there were craters and sunspots, it implied imperfection
    Galileo also observed phases of Venus
        this can be explained by the heliocentric model
    he also notices that the milky way is made up of stars
        not just a solid band
    sees the 4 moons of jupiter
        "meddicini stars"
        now called the Gallilean Satillites
    all of these things are in "The Starry Messenger"
        he was brought to trial twice for this book
        the church was more concerned with it being published in italian rather
            than latin
    after his second book, he recants his ideas under threat of torture and
        spends the rest of his life under house arrest
        during this time, he puts together his third books and redefines
            mechanics
        dies in 1642 (year of Newton's birth)

Newton's Laws
    Laws of motion:
        1. Things move at constant velocity unless a force acts on them
        2. F = m * a
        3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
    Law of universal gravitation:
        F = (G(M1)(M2))/r^2

    using these laws, you can describe all observable motion at that time
        this is the beginning of phyisics
        these are the first laws that are this general (apply to everything)

Defining Mass
    amount of "stuff" in something
        mass does not have a satisfactory definition today
        newton defined it as 'a quality that anything has that resists acceleration'


Mon Sep 12 12:08:26 EDT 2016
----------------------------


Mass vs Weight
    F=ma
    F is a weight, m is a mass
        using the kms (kilogram/meter/second) system:
            F = ma = (100kg)(9.8m/s) = 980kgm/s^2 = weight in Newtons
    mass is like weight that is not dependant on location (gravity)
    when comparing weight to mass, 2.2lbs ~ 1kg
        this is only true on the earth's surface

Newton's Third Law
    "if you exert a force on something, that thing exerts the same force back"
    if a person weighs 100kg:
        the person is exerting 980N on the floor
        the floor is exerting 980N on the person
        if this was not true, the person would accelerate through the floor
    this law mostly exists to allow Newton to work while ignoring details
    if you have two masses, m1 and m2, and they are spherical:
        you can treat the spheres as if all their mass is at the center
        if the distance between the centers is r:
            F = (G(m1)(m2))/r^2
    using the second and third laws (and the equation above), we can derive
        that centripetal acceleration = v^2/r

Measuring the Speed of Falling Objects
    F=ma
    if chalk is falling:
        a = G(Mearth)(Mchalk)/(Rearth-chalk)^2
            Rearth-chalk is the distance between the earth and the chalk
        mass does not affect the rate of falling
            suppose we have a cannonball and a wood ball attached to each other:
                according to aristotle, the wood ball would slow down the cannonball
                gallileo argued that because of this, they must fall at the same rate

What is G?
    G=6.67*10^-11 (Nt m^2)/kg^2
    G is a constant used to make the units line up on the F=ma equation
        using G in this form means we have to use the KMS system

Problems With These Estimation
    second law compares two different concepts:
        1) quality to resist acceleration (left side of equation)
        2) quality that attracts two objects to each other (right side of equation)
    these are very different concepts 
        this bothered Newton, and to a lesser extent Galileo
    "Why is the quality to resist motion the same as the quality of attraction
        to other objects?"
        Newton never answers these questions
        relativity does not make the distinction (inertial mass = gravitational mass)
    another problem is centripetal vs centrifugal acceleration
        centripetal:
            inertial, not accelerating according to the system by which we judge the motion
            F=ma
        centrifugal:
            non-inertial, not accelerating "" "" ""
                example: rotating system
                coordinate system is rotating
            F = ma + centrifugal term + coriolis term + other terms
        we have no devices to tell us if we are moving at constant velocity or not
            in a car with no windows, you can not tell if you are moving
                without acceleration
        because of this, Newton was force to define the concept of "absolute
            space" to make these judgements
            the problem is that absolute space can not be made out of matter
                m = 0
                Newton called it "God's Sensorium"
                    he also knew that this was not a satisfactory explanation
    these are important logical gaps in newtonian mechanics
        "should bother students" thinking about the nature of realityt
    despite these problems, the system still works

Parallax
    when viewing a star from two different positions in space, the angle
        between the two views is creates an angle
        1/2 of this angle is called the "parallax angle"

Motion of Planets
    eTotal = kinetic energy + gravitational potential energy
        KE = (1/2)mv^2
        GPE = -((GMm)/r)
        only KE and GPE matter in the scope of planetary motion
    as an object approaches a star, the KE is converted into GPE
        if the object is moving fast, the KE may dominate and cause the planet
            to avoid falling into orbit
        if the object is moving slow, the GPE may dominate and cause the planet
            to fall into orbit
    an object orbiting another object is a "bound system"
        if KE dominates and the objects are unbound, we have positive total
            energy
        if GPE dominates and the objects are bound, we have negative total
            energy
        bound orbits are circular or elliptical
        unbound orbits are hyperbolic
    the transition from unbound to bound happens when the energy is 0
        when energy is exactly zero, we get a parabolic orbit
    there are only 4 types of orbits
        one circular
        infinite elliptical
        one parabolic
        infinite hyperbolic
    these are the conic sections

Newton's Version of Kepler's 3rd Law
    p^2 = a^3
        only works for a star with the same mass as the sun
    p^2 = (4pi^2a^3)/(G(M+m))

Problems with Newtonian Mechanics
    newtonian mechanics had worked perfectly for the solar system, except for
        the precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit
        off by 45" per century
    at the end of 19th century, Kelvin did a review of physics saying that
        physics was done, with two clouds on the horizon:
        1. The Mercury Problem
            this problem lead to general relativity
            (this is not what he was trying to explain though (electrodynamis problem))
        2. The Unltraviolet Catastrophe (not covered in this class)
            this problem lead to quantum mechanics
    Kelvin was wrong about this, and wrong to think these two problems were small

Einstein's Mechanics (Special Relativity)
    in the 19th century, phyisics consists of 3 things:
        Newtonian Mechanics
        Electrodynamics
        Thermodynamics
    Einstein was approaching a problem with electrodynamics
        a stationary experiment should reurn the same results in a moving lab
            this works in Newtonian mechanics using Galilean transformations
        this problem does not work for results of experiments in electrodynamics
            this can be solved using Lorrentz transformations
        Einstein devloped a way to use Lorrentz transformations for both systems
    using the Lorrentz transformations for electrodynamics leads to the rules of SR
    rules of special relativity:
        1) time slows down in moving frames of reference
            l = l0 * sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2))
                c is the speed of light
                the value of v^2/c^2 is so small it is almost immeasureable
        2) lengths contract in the direction of motion in moving labs
        3) E = mc^2
            (equivalence between matter and energy)
    SR deals with non-accelerated motion (a = 0)
    Minkowski discovered that special relativity makes more sense if you think
        of it in a 4 dimensional space
        3 dimensions of space, 1 dimension of time

Principle of Equivalence
    imagine you are on the surface of the Earth
        g = 9.8 m/s^2
        if you are in a box with no gravity and a 9.8 m/s^2, you can not tell
            the difference
        this means that "gravity" is really a property of space
    rules of general relativity:
        1. matter tells spacetime how to curve or deform
        2. curved space tells matter how to move
            things move in straight lines (Galileo was right)
            straight lines in curved space don't look straight
