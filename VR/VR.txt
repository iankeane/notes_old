Unity Basics
    unity projects are just folders
    four folders in total
        Assets
            jpgs and other objects for the game
        Library
            converts assets for platform
        ProjectSettings
            information about how the project is organized
        Temp
            can be deleted
    projects are arranged into scenes
        scenes are files
        first action should be to save the default scene as something
        scenes can be used as levels, or as layers of a level
            ex: can have an enemies scene, empty level scene, etc
    views
        perspective view
            useful for seeing things the way the eye will see
        orthographic view
            useful for lining things up
    layers
        can be adjusted to have different properties
    local and global space
        programmatically, we are always working with local space
        local/global space for transformation can be toggled in the editor
    inspector window
        can be locked to one object (useful for moving other things in the
            scene while editing the first)
        contains all the components of the object
            everything in the game is an object
            an object is just a container for components
        objects can be tagged in the inspector window
            sometimes tagging can lead to sloppy code
        layers are edited in the inspector window as well
    components
        transform
            cannot be deleted, every object has a transform
            contains position, rotation, and scale
            best to edit to round values
                hold command to snap to grid and snap rotation
        mesh filter
            creates the mesh itself
        mesh renderer
            controls the material for the mesh
            every mesh renderer has a shader
                albedo modifies color
                unity only allows editing in 8-bit color
        camera
            controls whether the skybox is drawn or not
            clipping plane is set here (draw distance)
                affects the depth buffer
                also controls how close you can see something
            viewport rectangle can be used to draw multiple cameras or limit one
                camera to part of the screen
                can be used, for example, to make a rearview camera
            target texture
                this is how you make render textures
    lighting
        no lighting by default
        light seen in the scene is "ambient lighting"
            edited under window > lighting
            affects how well lit objects look
            skybox has ambient lighting as well
    unity game loop
        see diagram
        update
        coroutines
        animation
        lateupdate
        rendering
        coroutines
            yield WaitForEndOfFrame
        also see basic unity monobehavior diagram
            disregard ongui
    console window
        prints debugging information

Scripts
    a script is a component on an object
        it is a good idea to have a script that has the same name as the object
    it is a good idea NOT to try to change the name of a script after creation

UnityScript Functions
    Start()
    Update()
    time.deltatime
    debug.log
        prints to the console


    **Note: in lighting window, turn off "auto" under other settings
