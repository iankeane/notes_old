Bivariate Analysis
    the category of stats methods used when we have two vars
        one of the two vars is the outcome var
            this is called the response variable
            the var on which comparisons are made
        the other is a binary var that specifies the categories
            this is the explanatory var
            specifies the groups

Dependent and Independent Samples
    most comparisons of groups use ind samples
        the observations in one sample are independent of those in the other sample
        e.g. randomized experiments that randomly allocate subjects to two treatments
        or when an obs. study separates subjects according to their value for an explanatory var
    when two samples have the same subjects, they are dependant
        dep. samples also result when data are matched pairs
        they also occure when each subject is observed two times
            so we have two samples from the same people

Comparing Two Proportions
    for cat. response vars, infrences compare groups in terms of their pop.
        proportions in a particular category
    p₁ = pop. proportion of group one
    p₂ = pop. proportion of group two
    we can compare the groups by (p₁-p₂)
    this is estimated by (phat₁ - phat₂)

SE for Comparing Two Proportions
    (phat₁ - phat₂) has a standard deviation
        this SE describes variability around the mean of the samp distr of the estimate

C.I. for the Diff Between Two Population Proportions
    a C.I. takes the estimate and adds/subs a margin of error based on the SE
    the samp. dist. of (phat₁ - phat₂) is approximately normaly when the sample size is large
        to get the margin of error, we multiply the SE by a z-score from the norm distr table
            (phat₁ - phat₂) += z(SE)
    we can be x% confident that the pop prop of x is between (interval) higher for p₁ than for p₂

Interpreting a C.I. that Compares Proportions
    check whether - falls in the C.I.
        if so, it it is possible that phat₁ = phat₂, but not necessarily true
    if all values in the C.I. for (phat₁ - phat₂) are positive, (p₁ - p₂) > 0, or p₁ > p₂
    if all values in the C.I. for (phat₁ - phat₂) are negative, (p₁ - p₂) < 0, or p₁ < p₂
        the interval shows how much larger/smalle p₁ might be
    the magnitude of values in the C.I. tells you how large any true difference is
        if the C.I. is near 0, the true diff may be relatively small

Two-Sided Significance Test for Comparing Two Population Proportions
    1. Assumptions:
        a categorical response var for two groups
        ind. random smples
        n₁ and n₂ are large enough to have 5 succ/4 fails in each group if
            using a two sided alternative
    2. Hypothesis:
        Null: H₀: p₁ = p₂ (or p₁-p₂ = 0)
        Alt: Ha: p₁ != p₂ (or one sided Ha)
    3. Test Statistic:
        z = (phat₁ - phat₂)/se
        se = sqrt(phat(1-phat)((1/n₁)+(1/n₂)))
            where phat is the pooled estimate
    4. P-value:
        p-val = two-tail probabilty from the st. norm. dist. of values more
            extreme than observed z test stat if H₀ is true
    5. Conclusion:
        smaller P-vals give stronger evidence against H₀
        check against significance level

One Sided Ha
    the one-sided Ha:p₁ > p₂ predicts (phat₁-phat₂) > 0 and z >0
        the p-val is then a right0tail probability

10.2

Comparing two means
    we can compare two groups on a quant. resp. var by comparing their means
    the SE of the samp distr of (xbar₁ - xbar₂) describes how well the
        difference (xbar₁ - xbar₂) estimates the difference between the population means

Interpreting a C.I. for a Difference of Means
    check whether 0 falls in the interval
        if it does, it is possible that μ₁ = μ₂
    if interval > 0, infer μ₁ > μ₂
    if interval < 0, infer μ₁ < μ₂

Significance Tests Comparing Population Means
    1. Assumptions:
        a quant. resp. var for two groups
        ind. random samples
        approx. norm pop. dist for each group
    2. Hypotheses:
        H₀: μ₁ = μ₂
        Ha: μ₁ != μ₂ (or one-sided Ha)
    3. Test Statistic:
        t = (xbar₁-xbar₂)/SE
        SE = sqrt((s₁²/n₁)/(s₂²/n₂))
    4. P-value:
        pval = two tail probability from t dist of values even more extreme
            than observed t stat, assuming H₀ is true with df
    5. Conclusion:
        Smaller pvals give stringer evidence against H₀

Comparing Means, Assuming Equal Populatoin SD's
    used when it is reasonable to expect the variability as well as the mean to be the same
        requires the assumption σ₁ = σ₂
