Nonparametric Statistical Methods
    do not require the assumption of a norm dist
    use soly ranking of the subjects on the y var

Wilcoxon Test
    useful in two cases:
        1. when the data are ranks rather than quant measurements
        2. when it's inappropriate to assume normality and the ordinary stat
            method is not robust to violations of normality
    ties often occur when we rank observations
        if this happens, we average the ranks in assigning them to subjects

Comparing Two Groups by Ranking
    we can summarize an outcome by finding the mean rank for each group and
        taking their difference
    if two treatments have identical effects, all outcomes are equally likely
        using the possible outcomes we can construct a samp dist for the
            difference between mean ranks
    if the response variable is quantative, we convert the observations to ranks

Wilcoxon Rank Sum Statistic
    the W test can equivalently use the sum or mean of the ranks in just one of
        the samples as the t stat
        this is because the ranks in one sample determine the ranks in the
            other sample

Large Sample P-Vals Us a Norm Samp Dist
    uses a z stat witha p-val based on a norm dist approx of the samp dist
        this is because the diff between the sample mean ranks (or the sum of
            ranks for one sample) has an approx normal samp dist
        z = (diff btw samp mean ranks)/se
        se comes from software

Nonparametric Estimation Comparing Two Groups
    nonparam estimation tests also do not require norm pop dists
        it does require pop dists for the two groups to have the same shape
    when the response is quant we can compare a measure of center for the two groups
        Ch 10 did this for mean
    nonparam methods are often used when the y dist may be skewed
        then it may be more informative to estimate each group by median
    software estimates the difference between pop medians by:
        for every pair of subjects (one from each group), take diff of y vars
        the point estimate is the median of all those diffs

Proportion of Better Responses for a Group


15.2

Kruskal-Wallis Test
    compares mean ranks of several groups
        uses an ANOVA F test
    assumptions:
        ind rand samples
        identical pop dists for the y var
    test determines the ranks for the entire sample and finds the samp mean
        rank for each group
    the Kruskal-Wallis test does not assum normal pop dists, so it is safer to
        use with samples when not much info is available about their dist shapes
    it's also useful when the data are ranks and we don't have quant values
