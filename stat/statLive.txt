Common errors with quiz
    lurking variable was regression to the mean
        
    CI for B: (0.128, .296)
        p value for b: <.001
    B=0 is not in the interval
        (B is beta)
        0 is not a reasonable value
        reject H0: B=0
        small p value
        having the sample slope in the interval doesn't tell us anything because
            that's how we defined the interval

T statistic in JMP
    you have everything youn eed in the regular output
    t = (bi-0)/SEbi
        bi i= b sub i = run estimeate
        SEbi = Run std error

CI for Bi = bi +- tn*-2(SEbi)
    t*n-2 = t star sub n - 2
        which is t stat with DF = n-2

alpha tells you the probability of type 1 error

doing an f test protects against the problem that starting with multiple t
    tests can lead to high type 1 error rates
