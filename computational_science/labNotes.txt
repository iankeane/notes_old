What is MatLab?
    matlab is a high level language with tools to facilitate math computation
        weakly typed
    matrix indices begin at 1 in matlab

Matrix Functions
    zeros(M,N)
        generate a MxN matrix of zeros
        M is rows, N is columns
    ones(M,N)
        NxM matrix of ones
    rand(M,N)
        MxN matrix of uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1
    Arr(n,:)
        returns the entire nth row of Arr
    Arr(:,n)
        returns the entire nth column of Arr
    Arr(x:y,n)
        returns row n from index x to y
    Arr = [xy] 
        concatenates x and y and assigns the result to Arr
    Arr = [x;y]
        makes a matrix with a new column for each row of x and y

Matrix Operations
    Declaration
        [1, 2; 1, 2] makes a 2x2 matrix
    Addition
        adds all the elements of both arrays
    Subtraction
        same but reversed
    Multiplication
        element-wise multiplicaton (???)
    Transposition (apostraphe operator)
        each row is made into a column, and vice versa
            row 1 is now col 1, row 2 is now col 2
    Dot Operator

Plotting Functions
    plot()
    stem()

Display Functions
    title()
    xlabel()
    ylabel()
    legend()

Operators
    ==, ~=, <, >, <=, >=
    automatically return 1 or 0

3D Plotting
    meshgrid()
    surf()
