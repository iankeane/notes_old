1.1

Classes of Computers
    Desktop
        designed for use by an individual
        incorporates a graphics display, keyboard, and mouse
    Server
        used for running larger programs for multiple users
        typically accessesd only via a network
        widest range in cost and capability
    Supercomputer
        class with the highest performance and cost
        configured as servers
        oriented towards carrying a large workload
    Datacenters
        similar to supercomputers
        considered as large clusters of computers
    Embedded Computers
        the largest class of computers
        widest range of applications and performance

Components of Program Performance
    Algorithm
    Programming Language
    Programming Compiler
    Programming Archetecture
    Processor and Memory System
    I/O system (hardware and operating system)


1.2

Software Layer Hierarchy
    from high to low level:
    Applications Software
    Systems Software
        Operating System
            interfaces between a user's program and the hardware
            provides supervisory functions and services, including:
                handling I/O operations
                allocating storage and memory
                providing protected sharing of the computer amongs applications
        Compiler
            translates a program into instructions that the hardware can
                execute
    Hardware

Translation to Hardware Instructions
    Binary
        "Machine Language"
        this is the lowest level computer language
        originally computers were instructed in binary by hand
    Assembler
        "Assembly Language"
        this was the first computer compiler
        a simple program that translates a symbolic instruction to binary
        requires the programmer to write one line of code for each hardware
            instruction
    Compiler
        high level languages still used today
        translate powerful language into assembly
